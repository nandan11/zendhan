            <h2>id="overview">What Are Equity Funds?</h2>
            <p>Equity mutual funds are investment vehicles that pool money from multiple investors to primarily invest in the stock market. These funds give investors exposure to equity markets without requiring them to select individual stocks themselves.</p>
            
            <div class="info-card">
                <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
                <p>Equity funds offer higher potential returns compared to debt instruments, but also come with higher risk and volatility. They are generally recommended for investors with a long-term horizon (5+ years) and moderate to high risk tolerance.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>In India, equity mutual funds are categorized based on market capitalization, investment strategy, and sectoral focus. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has established clear classifications to help investors understand what they're investing in.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content-block" id="market-cap">
            <h2>Types of Equity Funds Based on Market Capitalization</h2>
            <p>Market capitalization refers to the total value of a company's outstanding shares. SEBI classifies equity funds into the following categories based on the market cap of companies they invest in:</p>

                <h3>1. Large-Cap Funds</h3>
                <p>These funds invest primarily in the top 100 companies by market capitalization in India.</p>
                
                <div class="info-card">
