        <h2>What Are Mutual Funds?</h2>
        <p>A mutual fund is a professionally managed investment fund that pools money from many investors to purchase securities. These securities can include stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other assets.</p>
        
        <p>When you invest in a mutual fund, you're essentially buying a portion of a diversified portfolio managed by financial experts. This makes mutual funds an excellent choice for individuals who want to invest but may not have the time, knowledge, or resources to build and manage their own portfolio of securities.</p>

            <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
            <p>Mutual funds offer small investors access to professionally managed, diversified portfolios of equities, bonds, and other securities, which would be difficult to create with a small amount of capital.</p>

        <h3>How Do Mutual Funds Work?</h3>
        <p>When you invest in a mutual fund, your money is pooled with that of other investors. A professional fund manager then invests this pool according to the fund's stated objective. The fund manager conducts research, selects the securities, and monitors the fund's performance.</p>
        
        <p>As an investor, you own units or shares of the mutual fund, not the underlying assets directly. The value of these units, known as Net Asset Value (NAV), changes daily based on the performance of the investments held by the fund.</p>
        
        <p>Mutual funds can earn money in three ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dividend payments:</strong> When companies in the portfolio pay dividends</li>
            <li><strong>Capital gains:</strong> When securities in the fund are sold at a profit</li>
            <li><strong>Net Asset Value (NAV) increase:</strong> When the value of the fund's holdings increases</li>
        </ul>
