        <h2>What Are Mutual Funds?</h2>
        <p>A mutual fund is a professionally managed investment fund that pools money from many investors to purchase securities. These securities can include stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other assets.</p>
        
        <p>When you invest in a mutual fund, you're essentially buying a portion of a diversified portfolio managed by financial experts. This makes mutual funds an excellent choice for individuals who want to invest but may not have the time, knowledge, or resources to build and manage their own portfolio of securities.</p>
        
        <div class="info-card">
            <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
            <p>Mutual funds offer small investors access to professionally managed, diversified portfolios of equities, bonds, and other securities, which would be difficult to create with a small amount of capital.</p>

        <h3>How Do Mutual Funds Work?</h3>
        <p>When you invest in a mutual fund, your money is pooled with that of other investors. A professional fund manager then invests this pool according to the fund's stated objective. The fund manager conducts research, selects the securities, and monitors the fund's performance.</p>
        
        <p>As an investor, you own units or shares of the mutual fund, not the underlying assets directly. The value of these units, known as Net Asset Value (NAV), changes daily based on the performance of the investments held by the fund.</p>
        
        <p>Mutual funds can earn money in three ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dividend payments:</strong> When companies in the portfolio pay dividends</li>
            <li><strong>Capital gains:</strong> When securities in the fund are sold at a profit</li>
            <li><strong>Net Asset Value (NAV) increase:</strong> When the value of the fund's holdings increases</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>Example: How a Mutual Fund Makes Money</h4>
    <p>Let's look at a simple example of "Zendhan Growth Fund" with round numbers:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Starting point:</strong> You invest ₹10,000 in the fund which buys stocks in 10 different companies (₹1,000 in each).</p>
    
    <div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 15px; border-radius: 4px; margin: 15px 0;">
        <p><strong>Dividend payments:</strong> Three companies in the portfolio pay annual dividends of ₹20 each. The fund collects ₹60 in dividends (3 × ₹20) and either:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>Reinvests this money to buy more stocks (Growth option), or</li>
            <li>Passes the dividends to you as income (Dividend option)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 15px; border-radius: 4px; margin: 15px 0;">
        <p><strong>Capital gains:</strong> The fund manager sells shares of one company that was purchased for ₹1,000 but is now worth ₹1,200. This creates a capital gain of ₹200. The fund can:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>Reinvest this ₹1,200 in another opportunity</li>
            <li>At year-end, distribute some capital gains to investors</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 15px; border-radius: 4px; margin: 15px 0;">
        <p><strong>NAV increase:</strong> The remaining shares in your fund that haven't been sold increase in value from ₹9,000 to ₹10,800 due to market growth. This increases the NAV of your investment.</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>Your initial investment: ₹10,000</li>
            <li>New value: ₹12,000 (₹10,800 + ₹1,200)</li>
            <li>Increase in NAV: 20%</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Your ₹10,000 investment has grown to ₹12,000 + ₹60 in dividends = ₹12,060, representing a return of 20.6%.</p>
