        <h2 id="what-are-debt-funds">What are Debt Mutual Funds?</h2>
        <p>Debt mutual funds are investment funds that primarily invest in fixed-income securities such as government bonds, corporate bonds, treasury bills, and money market instruments. These funds are considered relatively safer than equity funds as they provide stable returns with lower risk. They are ideal for conservative investors who seek regular income and capital preservation.</p>
        
        <div class="info-card">
          <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
          <p>Debt funds offer more stable returns than equity funds and are suitable for investors with lower risk tolerance. They invest in instruments that pay regular interest, making them ideal for generating periodic income.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="content-block" >
        <h2 id="how-they-work">How Do Debt Mutual Funds Work?</h2>
        <p>When you invest in a debt fund, the fund manager allocates your money into different debt instruments based on the fund's objective. The returns from these funds come from two sources:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Interest Income</strong> – The bonds and securities in which the fund has invested pay periodic interest.</li>
          <li><strong>Capital Gains</strong> – If the fund manager sells a bond at a price higher than its purchase price, the fund earns a capital gain.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The performance of debt funds depends on factors like interest rate movements, credit quality of securities, and macroeconomic conditions.</p>

          <p>No, debt funds are not completely risk-free, though they generally carry lower risk than equity funds. They are subject to interest rate risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk. The level of risk varies based on the type of debt fund you choose.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>During rising interest rate scenarios, it's generally advisable to invest in shorter-duration debt funds like liquid funds or ultra-short duration funds as they are less sensitive to interest rate changes.
