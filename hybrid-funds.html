        <p>Hybrid mutual funds are investment schemes that allocate assets across multiple categories—mainly equities and debt—to balance risk and return. These funds are designed for investors who want moderate risk with stable returns, making them suitable for both conservative and aggressive investors depending on the allocation mix. The goal is to provide diversification, stability, and optimal returns based on market conditions.</p>
