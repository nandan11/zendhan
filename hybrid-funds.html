        <p>Hybrid mutual funds are investment schemes that allocate assets across multiple categories—mainly equities and debt—to balance risk and return. These funds are designed for investors who want moderate risk with stable returns, making them suitable for both conservative and aggressive investors depending on the allocation mix. The goal is to provide diversification, stability, and optimal returns based on market conditions.</p>

            <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
            <li><strong>Diversified Portfolio:</strong> Reduces risk compared to pure equity funds.</li>
            <li><strong>Better risk-adjusted returns:</strong> Better returns compared to quity-only or debt-only funds.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Asset Allocation:</strong> Capitalize on market conditions.</li>
        </div>
       <p>Hybrid funds make money through multiple sources, which makes them more resilient than pure equity funds and more rewarding than pure debt funds.</p>

      <div class="info-card">
    <h4>Example: How a Hybrid Mutual Fund Makes Money</h4>
    <p>Let's look at a simple example of "Diverso Balanced Advantage Fund" with round numbers:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Starting point:</strong> You invest ₹100,000 in the fund which allocates 60% to stocks (₹60,000) and 40% to debt instruments (₹40,000).</p>
    
    <div class="example-block">
        <p><strong>Capital Appreciation:</strong> The equity portion increases by 15% due to stock market growth:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Initial equity investment: ₹60,000</li>
            <li>Value after appreciation: ₹69,000</li>
            <li>Gain: ₹9,000</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="example-block">
        <p><strong>Interest Income:</strong> The debt portion earns 8% interest from bonds and government securities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Initial debt investment: ₹40,000</li>
            <li>Interest earned: ₹3,200</li>
            <li>New debt value: ₹43,200</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="example-block">
        <p><strong>Dividend Income:</strong> The fund receives dividends from stocks in its portfolio:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reliance Industries: 500 shares × ₹20 per share = ₹10,000</li>
            <li>Tata Consultancy Services: 200 shares × ₹30 per share = ₹6,000</li>
            <li>Total dividend income: ₹16,000</li>
            <li>The fund reinvests these dividends (Growth option) or distributes them to investors (Dividend option)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="example-block">
        <p><strong>Automatic Rebalancing:</strong> As equity markets rise, the fund rebalances by moving some equity profits to debt:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The fund sells ₹5,000 worth of stocks at their peak</li>
            <li>This amount is invested in corporate bonds at 9% interest</li>
            <li>This preserves gains and reduces risk</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="example-block">
        <p><strong>Arbitrage Profit:</strong> The fund executes an arbitrage trade:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Buys Infosys at ₹1,500 in cash market</li>
            <li>Sells Infosys futures at ₹1,530</li>
            <li>Risk-free profit: ₹30 per share × 100 shares = ₹3,000</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Your ₹100,000 investment has grown to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Equity portion: ₹69,000 - ₹5,000 (rebalanced) = ₹64,000</li>
        <li>Debt portion: ₹43,200 + ₹5,000 (rebalanced) = ₹48,200</li>
        <li>Arbitrage profit: ₹3,000</li>
        <li>Total value: ₹115,200 (not including dividends)</li>
        <li>Return: 15.2% (or 31.2% if dividends are included in growth option)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The hybrid approach delivered strong returns while reducing risk through diversification and rebalancing.</p>
